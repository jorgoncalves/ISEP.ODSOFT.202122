# ODSOFT

In this folder you should add **all** artifacts developed in exercises and projects of the ODSOFT course.

### Structure of Folders

You should create a subfolder for each exercise/component. For instance, subfolder "exercise1/component1" will contain all the artifacts for component 1 of exercise 1 of ODSOFT; subfolder "exercise1/component2" will contain all the artifacts for component 2 of exercise 1 of ODSOFT, etc.

**Note:** If for some reason you need to bypass these guidelines please ask for directions with your teacher and **always** state the exceptions in your commits and issues in bitbucket.
